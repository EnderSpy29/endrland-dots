Most of the themeing won't work unless you have the Catpuccin GTK and QT themes set up.
do do so run 'yay -S catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha'
then install 'qt5ct' and 'qt6ct' and 'kvantum' and 'kvantum-qt5'
your going to want to head to https://github.com/catppuccin/Kvantum/tree/main
install your preffered theme (use `Mocha-mauve` if you want it to match the GTK theme) and install it in kvantum.
then set kvantum as the theme in qt5ct and qt6ct

Install "grim" and "slurp" to get screenshots to work
